# TrustUS_Project
TrustUs project’s primary focus is to support and help the elderly.  Some goods and services may be especially valuable to the over-60s.  The idea that elderly people aren’t using the internet is now extremely outdated. Older age groups are less likely to be using social media and shopping online. Older people also have a great deal to gain from e-Commerce. As mobility reduces with age, having goods and services delivered to your door makes a great deal of sense. Therefore, what this project contains is a simple e-commerce website that provides the elderly with services and goods that could be of more need to them. For the goods and services, there will be a review system so they can check on what to buy.
